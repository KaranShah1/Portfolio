									<h4>Project Goals</h4>
									<p>After two summers with the department, my goal was to enhance the summer college experience by identifying 
										and addressing technological gaps to contribute to smoother program operations.
										</p>
										<h4>Technologies Used</h4>
										<li>Python (folium)</li>
										<li>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</li>
										<li>Large Language Models</li>
										<li>Promt Engineering</li><br>

										<h4>Tools</h4>
										<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
									
										<li>Python Libraries</li>
										<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
										<li>Clustering</li><br>

										

										<h4>My Contribution</h4>
										<li> Collaborated with directors to streamline decision-making by identifying critical data needs, which led 
											to the development of an automated residential forecast system, saving 2 hours of daily manual 
											processing.</li>
										<li> Launched a multilingual chatbot with Generative AI capabilities to improve communication within the 
											pre-college office for SRCs and Interns (SRIs). This chatbot centralizes resources, allowing SRCs to 
											access training documents and resolve common issues directly. With this pilot solution involving 60 
											users, we expect a 50% reduction in call volume, significantly enhancing operational efficiency. </li>
										<li>
											Created an interactive zip code map for the 2024 Summer College application, which was used to 
											identify zip codes for a targeted $100,000 email campaign focused on high-income households.</li><br>

											<h4>Learning Outcomes Demostrated</h4>
                                            <p>This role presented new challenges and required me to independently problem-solve using available 
											documentation. I strengthened my understanding of aligning technical solutions with business needs and 
											developed effective, resourceful solutions. This experience allowed me to apply classroom knowledge to real world problems, effectively bridging academic learning with practical application.</p>

												<h3>Christopher Cofer</h3>

											<!-- Visible part of the text by default -->
											As the Exec. Dir. of the Office of Pre-College Programs, and previously the Exec. Dir. of Summer & Winter Sessions at Syracuse University (SU) for the last 17 years, I have had the pleasure of employing many SU undergraduate and grad students in a variety of capacities. When I state that Karan's significant contributions and positive impact on our team and operations have far exceeded those of any previous student employee, I am doing so with utmost confidence.
											<br><br>
											
											<!-- Additional text to show on 'Read more' -->
											<span class="more-text" style="display: none;">
												In January 2024, we found an opportunity to bring Karan back to our office to assist in the planning and preparation for Summer College 2024. Prior to the program's start in July, Karan applied his data science skills to build an automated residential forecast model. During the program, Karan was instrumental in supporting the management of all aspects of student affairs, student activities, and residence life for the Summer College – On Campus experience, supporting close to 1,000 students from 37 U.S. states and 24 countries.
												<br><br>
										
												Karan is the only student employee we have retained on staff following the conclusion of our annual Summer College program. Since August, he has been revolutionizing our systems and processes by leveraging his expertise in technology-driven improvements as a Data & Technology Specialist for our office. One noteworthy project includes Karan’s development and launch of an internal multilingual staff chatbot, which has been nothing short of revolutionary for our office. Another significant project he spearheaded was an interactive zip code map of all Summer College applicants from the last three years. This tool has positioned us to more accurately target paid email campaigns and social media marketing towards high-income households, potentially saving us tens of thousands in unnecessary spending over the next few years.
												<br><br>
										
												From Summer Residential Intern to Data & Technology Specialist, Karan has deepened his understanding of what it takes to successfully run our programs, and he has had the opportunity to leverage his knowledge, skills, expertise, and creativity to make a profoundly transformative impact on how we utilize technology to improve our processes and ultimately enhance the student experience and satisfaction of our programs. Karan is the only student employee I have invited to attend our weekly staff meetings and our all-staff annual retreat—an invitation extended in recognition of his unique contributions and integral role on our team.
												<br><br>
										
												Karan is an extremely valuable member of our team, and I will miss him dearly when he moves on. Yes, I will miss him for his overwhelming contributions to our collective work, but even more so, I will miss him for his professionalism, work ethic, kindness, and simply for being himself. He is an absolute pleasure to work with daily. I am confident Karan will be an exceptional addition to any company or organization fortunate enough to hire him, and I believe it would be a mistake to overlook Karan for another candidate.
