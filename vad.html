									<h4>Achievement</h4>
									
										<p>
                                            I developed a strong ability to tell compelling stories through data, culminating in receiving a perfect A for the 
                                            course.
                                        </p>

										<h4>Project Goals</h4>
										<p>The Green Prosperity initiative presents a comprehensive exploration of the global transition toward sustainable 
                                            energy and its impact on national growth. Through a series of interconnected dashboards, this project delves 
                                            into the intricate dynamics of renewable energy adoption, investment trends, and the economic ramifications of 
                                            embracing green technologies. Each dashboard provides unique insights, ranging from global greenhouse gas 
                                            emissions to renewable energy investment trends, culminating in a holistic understanding of the interplay 
                                            between environmental sustainability and economic prosperity.</p>

                                                    of shares based on available funds, I managed to achieve a significant return despite the potential risks 
                                                    associated with lack of diversification. </li><br>

                                                            increasing my holdings to 1,275 shares </li>

                                                                This model recommended diversification across XLK (Technology), XLV (Healthcare), and XLF

                                                                capitalizing on its continued growth. </li><br>

                                                                                My analysis originally recommended purchasing 1,208 shares, but due to financial constraints, I was able to buy 1,148 shares. As profits grew between October 30th and November 10th, I bought an additional 82 shares, ultimately surpassing my initial goal by purchasing a total of 1,275 shares.
                                                                            </li>

                                                                                • Inspired by an article by Ricardo Fernandez, I deviated from the model's recommendation of diversification and opted to concentrate investments in XLK. I recognized the risks involved, especially related to beta (volatility), but I was confident in the sector’s short-term growth potential. This move paid off, but I acknowledge that future results could vary depending on market conditions.
                                                                            </li>

They are traded like stocks and offer diversification within a single security. This project enhanced my understanding of how ETFs operate, how to analyze their performance, and how they compare to individual stocks in terms of risk and return.
                                                                                </li>

The model uses beta (sensitivity to market movements) and alpha (performance relative to the expected return) to suggest optimal investments.<br>
                                                                                    • The Information Ratio (IR) measures a portfolio manager's ability to generate excess returns relative to the risk taken. By using this ratio, I was able to identify ETFs that offered high returns for the level of risk involved.
                                                                                </li>

                                                                                    • While diversification is a fundamental principle of risk management, I chose a concentrated investment strategy. Although this heightened my risk exposure, I was able to manage it by continuously monitoring XLK’s performance and adjusting my holdings based on market data.
                                                                                </li>

The technology sector, represented by XLK, outperformed during this period, validating my strategy of concentrating my investments in this area.
