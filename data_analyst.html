										<h4>My Contribution</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            Since July 2023, I have dedicated 10 hours each week to this role, reporting directly to the Functional Business 
                                            Analyst and Designated School Officer (DSO). My responsibilities include ensuring data accuracy and 
                                            compliance with government regulations for over 4,000 international students. This involves validating and 
                                            cleaning data, creating batches for SEVIS submission by the DSO, and analyzing visitor management system 
                                            data with over 18,000 rows. I also create dashboards that visualize various travel signature modes—such as 
                                            Advisor on Call, express, and portal-based signatures—enhancing logistics and operational planning
                                        </p>                                         
										

                                            <h4>Learning Outcomes Demostrated</h4>
                                            <p>Working with international student data has deepened my focus on Data Integrity, Data Privacy, Data 
                                                Compliance, and Data Confidentiality. The I-20 form, a vital document for international students, represents 
                                                years of hard work and dedication toward their educational goals. Through understanding the process behind 
                                                generating this document, I’ve gained insight into the full lifecycle of an international student at Syracuse 
                                                University. This includes their initial matriculation (referred to as "Initial student"), status change upon arrival 
                                                in the U.S. (updated to "active"), CPT and OPT filings, and "Post Completing/Graduated" status upon 
                                                graduation. My role requires handling sensitive data, including SSNs. Notably, I identified a data safety issue 
                                                and advocated for SSN masking, resulting in an update that strengthened data protection.</p>

											Karan is a brilliant young professional with a strong work ethic and a deep commitment to both his academic journey and job responsibilities. He demonstrates an unwavering passion for learning, a genuine care for others, and profound respect for all team members.
											<br><br>
											
											<!-- Additional text to show on 'Read more' -->
											<span class="more-text" style="display: none;">
												Karan embodies the qualities of not only a role model but a true leader. As an international graduate student working 20 hours on campus during the academic year, he exhibits an extraordinary ability to balance his academics and work without missing classes. This balance is a testament to his dependability and trustworthiness, earning the trust of his supervisors, colleagues, and peers.
												<br><br>
										
												His organizational and time management skills have been invaluable in supporting my work as a Functional Business Analyst, particularly after the implementation of a new system interfacing between the University's PeopleSoft (an Oracle product), Terra Dotta ISSS, and SEVIS, the government immigration system. Karan’s analytical skills have been precise in validating data across these systems, and his expertise in developing various reports has enhanced our services and event planning each semester.
												<br><br>
										
												From Summer Residential Intern to Data & Technology Specialist, Karan has deepened his understanding of what it takes to successfully run our programs, and he has had the opportunity to leverage his knowledge, skills, expertise, and creativity to make a profoundly transformative impact on how we utilize technology to improve our processes and ultimately enhance the student experience and satisfaction of our programs. Karan is the only student employee I have invited to attend our weekly staff meetings and our all-staff annual retreat—an invitation extended in recognition of his unique contributions and integral role on our team.
												<br><br>
										
												Karan has immense potential. He is a brilliant diamond who will continue to shine, no matter where his professional and personal journey takes him.
